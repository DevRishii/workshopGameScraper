In this case after designing the route of the knight's tour, I have put a 64 character message on its path - the message will help find the route of the knight since gibberish will evidently not be correct and similarly the choices the knight can take will help trace the message. Think of it as two puzzles decoding each other.

As a clue, the message is chess related but does not require any specific chess knowledge.",Yes,No,No,44,N/A,0,N/A

ATTENTION!
This addon may still be incomplete due to an understaffed team and time constraints. Any constructive feedback from you, the community, in order to aid the development of this mod over time will be greatly appreciated.

This is a voice pack for the starter character QP, the unyielding dog-eared pudding lover of QP Shooting fame, fandubbing her and her announcer voice into English! This also works on the bonus character QP (Dangerous). Our hoodie-wearing heroine is portrayed by the energetic and upbeat kylesmigyles, a rising VTuber who does a lot of neat coordinated Re:Zero readings with Studio Reverie!

Additional tuning work and testing was done by Ashuraa.

Please let us know what you think! More creators will be credited as they lend a hand in making this project as good as it can be. You can also find me over on Ko-fi[ko-fi.com] if you want to financially support my community-driven gaming endeavours, but that is unnecessary; I recommend you support everyone else involved before the middleman that is me (even though I also worked hard on this project)!

If you like this mod, remember to like it in-game, fav it, comment, etc. Thanks & have fun! Likewise, if you find errors, please report them. i try to run as many tests as I can, but its still possible something slipped through.

Note:
If you already have an arrow size increasing/replacing mod, you need to turn it off in the mod menu, check this one on, and then restart the game. Field icons seem to not reset until after a fresh start up, regardless of whether you press the refresh button in the mod menu.

princelaharlsama",5.446 MB,Feb 25 @ 12:33pm,Feb 26 @ 12:22am,"The Sora Overhaul. A project over a year in the making. This mod features the incredible art of community fan favorites Coffgirl and King. One a tried and true legend, and the other a quickly rising star- Both stellar artists and contest winners.

Mod Features:
New character model/unit card art
All colors compatible
All hair compatible
All costumes compatible, some replaced with new ones.

In short- this is the official/complete release, much like a DLC. Everything that has been released at this time is in working order.

Compatibility:
Enhanced Colors for Base Game Characters: The Sora Overhaul needs to be placed higher in the build order priority list to avoid overlap errors with this mod.
Sora’s Sweater: Semi-compatible. You can place it below this mod to keep it working for Sora (M), but it is not compatible with this mod, as it uses the old model. Would love to see a version for this mod, but it was out of scope.

Known visual glitches. Please do not report the following::
Christmas Color has its shoulders chopped when using a nondefault hair color + crown/santa hat. This is a result of how OJ applies alphamask 04/05. Even if the character doesn’t have either alpha, they override alpha 03/09 which causes the error. Subsequently, unfixable until FBF patches it. Happens on other characters (Kyoko, Sora M, etc).
Same as above but with the School Crashers Color. Far less noticeable however.
Christmas Color + Halloween 16’ has the Christmas Color leak behind it. There is no alpha on this hat, so it cannot cover the Christmas color. Using any color with 16’ doesn’t really make much sense in the context of this mod, however.
Blue color with nondefault hair color has a bit of its appearance chopped. Expected behavior as there is no alpha, but hardly noticeable.
Credits:
Coffgirl: 6 bases poses and layers used to make hair alphas
King: 9 Costumes, 3 colors (school, blue, Christmas)
Wanderlust: Commissioner, hair layers, alphamasks, standard colors, project compiler.

I would also like to give Coffgirl and King an additional shoutout. Both were extremely professional and adaptive to my requests, and delivered great work, culminating in this grand mod. I would also like to give a very special thanks to King for the sheer amount of excellent art he produced for this project. He produced an incredible 80 frames of art!!! -despite complications and the unforeseen degree of difficulty of the commission. Thank you both for your hard work and for being wonderful people to work with.

Unlike the Suguri Overhaul mod, this mod uses the same models but uses the heads from 診せる's swimsuit mod and better colors to freshen the appearance. This mod comes with fully working hair colors, unit colors, and accessories. This mod also upgrades the unit card, but does not have different hyper card art.

If you like this mod, remember to like it in-game, fav it, comment, etc. Thanks & have fun! Likewise, if you find errors, please report them. i try to run as many tests as I can, but its still possible something slipped through.

Full change List:
Greatly improved face.
Improved hands on some sprites- particularly the dice throw pose.
Darker pallet used to be more inline with modern characters and less washed out.
Bits have been swapped for the pet catcher bit sprites for consistency. Will match for default, green, yellow, and blue.
Bits are now much more aggressive on attack pose.
Fixed missing hair alphas for hairs 8-12 not present in 診せる's mod.
Christmas color now has colored shoes.
Christmas hat now better fits on Nanako's head.
Pumpkins are now HD to better match new units.
Changed unit card art.
There is now shading in Nanako's Christmas gremlin ear...yeah i dunno its in my notes.
Compatibility:
Enhanced Colors for Base Game Characters: The Nanako Overhaul needs to be placed higher in the build order priority list to avoid overlap errors with this mod.
Nanako Swimsuit & Nyanako: Not compatible, as both overwrite the unit files. Thus you can only use one or the other.

診せる: Face and hand sprites and most hair alphas. ( https://twitter.com/t3n3bra3 )
Please note that if 診せる asks that this mod be taken down, it will be.

Final note: ""What about new skins?"" Depending on what it is, the mod actually should keep operating without further adjustment on my part, as the character is nearly the same as it was originally. Thus as long as the alphamasks don;t cut anything, new additions should work fresh out of the gate.",No,Yes,No,N/A,N/A,N/A,4

- Added all remaining accessories except Jack-o-lantern heads, including the new Tiger Kigurumi, and gave some a new look (Halloween costumes and pig ears)
- Fixed reversed gradients in hair
- Fixed crowns and Santa hat

CREATOR'S NOTE:
Thank you so much for over 500 downloads on an incomplete mod! (lol). This project is now basically complete! I hope everyone likes it.

TO-DO LIST:
- Revisit Color alts?

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Slight clipping issues with certain hats in Attack pose
- ???

I don't really know if I have any future plans for fixing misc. details, but maybe if enough interest is shown in the project I will. Currently I have plans to redo the Hyper art, but maybe at a later date.

To do list:
- Hyper Art
- Fix colors eventually?

UPDATE 9/19/20 v1.3
Changelog:
- Fixed issues with Cow Kigurumi and RPG outfit.
- Replaced unit card illustration

UPDATE 9/19/20 v1.2
Changelog:
Hair colors now implemented as well as most hats!
Fullbody accessories (such as Halloween outfits) have been omitted so they do not ""glitch"" over the base texture, but are not implemented.
Red/blue and Christmas alt colors now default to the normal color scheme.
Also, Sinful Rose (Instrumental) has been added as BGM! (Big thanks to Vplus for the help)

Thanks ソラ for analyzing every single sound effect and doing all the audio editing, it wouldn't have been a thing without her help.

All sound effects have been amplified because at base volume they are very silent, you might want to reduce the volume a bit if you plan to use this, as ソラ probably went a little bit overboard with the amplification.

Feel free to comment if you think certain sound effects are a bit too loud or too silent or you have some better ideas for certain sound effects. In the case of the latter, I would appreciate it if you also tell me the SFX number in Rabi-Ribi (like SFX 063, SFX 247, etc).

Totally-from-scratch artwork created by me. No bases were used. There are other supplementary gijinka mods linked in my collection above, made by both me and others. :)

[Note: The last image in the screenshots was taken during Four Heavenly Kings mode, which is a mode exclusive to the Fool's Gambit event. I don't plan to mod this over another character.]

TO-DO LIST:
- More Co op bosses!
- Possibly illustration for Hyper card art, but not likely.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Displaced sprites in Four Heavenly Kings mode's GUI
- Defeat pose looks odd due to being high on the y-axis, will likely adjust the sprite in the future so that it can be placed lower down.

buckshotboo24",332.525 MB,"Jul 26, 2021 @ 8:30pm",Feb 14 @ 10:29pm,"This is The Mega Drive: a music replacement project that has the aim of replacing the music of 100% Orange Juice with music from official Sonic the Hedgehog series titles. This is an idea that has been in the works for at least a few months and is...conveniently now coming out during the 30th anniversary of the series. Totally planned!

This pack, at base, aims to replace most of the basic music you hear in game. This includes and is not limited to:
-Character Themes: all have been replaced
-Some Unique Hyper themes: all but the Special Stage tracks have been replaced
-Unique Board Themes: all have been replaced
-Win Game jingle
-Menu Music

At later points, this pack may cover additional songs such as cutscenes and credits music, potentially other sound effects, along with any other songs I've missed. The pack will also be retroactively updated when more characters or unique songs are added. All songs can also be subscribed to individually as well (they will release some days after the full pack releases). Any issues with the packs, such as volume balance, looping, or otherwise, can be mentioned through commenting on either this page or the individual mod's page.

I'd like to extend a thank you to JhroneKire who helped me with some of the song looping and trimming for the core pack development. I would also like to thank neogandw (he's a great artist, check him out: https://twitter.com/Neogandwatch ) for assisting me in assembling the visual thumbnails for the pack, as this would have taken me ages as a result. Finally, in the event people want to hear my thought process for the pack, I do plan on doing something (either a document or a twitter thread) that goes into detail on all of this. Check my twitter ( https://twitter.com/buckshotboo24 ) for the end results of that.

Thanks for subscribing, and I hope you enjoy the pack!

Support UI (matching Character select screen / hyper animations / icons / shop displays) mod now available at: https://gamebanana.com/mods/383864


Ever wanted more Animal Crossing in your life? This mod will replace all characters, cards, field panels, homestops, pets and associated text to make OJ Animal Crossing themed. Now with 282 playable characters!

Select 100% Animal Crossing instead of your language when loading the game to display the Character and Card names and associated text changes. (Apologies to players wanting other languages!)

Contains Animal Crossing reskins for:
- All playable Characters and Character colour variants, with additional clothing colour options under hair menu, and added customisations under accessories.
- All characters have at least 2 alternate characters assigned to their Cow/Tiger Kigu accessory slot, and some costume slots to allow you to play as 278 AC characters, and 4 mod only characters - eg Play as Bruce by selecting Papi's cow kigu costume. If an OJ costume is available for the character then the alternate character will have customisation options there - eg Saki's summer costume adds Cole over Sasha.
- New field spaces and homestops, with QOL updates, larger arrows, more colour variety, clearer text on spaces and unique numbered home panels.
- All playable cards edited, with associated text changes applied to a custom language pack.
- Co-op mode bosses. Bosses have text changes via 100%AC language pack.
- Bounty Hunt summons, bounties and Harbringer replaced, and new bounty quests set by AC characters.
- All pets and pet colour variants added, as extra villagers who travel with you. And an optional mod exists to change out pets for a different selection!
- Various QOL text changes in the 100% AC language option, including easier stat buff displays, an icon indicator for sweet cards, now as sleep cards and turn counts for field events.
- Optional Add-on mods available, changing UI, the arcade, dice, fields, hyper animations, co-op/BH displays, replacing Music, adding panel borders.

This mod will also continue to be updated to add any new DLC characters and event items as and when the game updates. - Usually within 24 hours of the update releasing, as I have many of the files pre-prepared to add now.
The support mod which updates files not available to mod on the steam workshop usually updates within 48 hours of an OJ update.

Changes:
-Krila is now called by her full name, Krilalaris, on her character card (It's official now!) and in the store
-Cuties are now called Sora & Sham (Idols) on the character card and in the store, making it consistent with the Japanese localization where they're called ソラ＆シャム（アイドル）(Sora&Shamu (aidoru) - ""Sora&Sham (Idols)"")
-The names of the Japanese artists are now all in the eastern name order, instead of some names being in the eastern and others in the western order. (It's official now as well!)
-Mimyuu (both regular and Jailbird) and Ceoreparque now only refer to themselves in 3rd person when they actually do so in the Japanese version (which is still a lot but not every time).
-The description of the Cupcake pet now uses degrees Celsius.
-Sweet Breaker is now called Sweebu instead of Sweebo in her campaign and in a few other places. In the Japanese localization her nickname is スイブ - ""Suibu"", which are 2 first characters of the first part of her name: スイート (Suīto, ""Sweet"") and the first character of the second part of her name: ブレイカー (Bureikā, ""Breaker"").

There are currently 57 modified characters, including all the base and most of the DLC characters. I plan to modify the rest of the roster.

As a fan of the former robot duo, and as a regular player of that lovely board game, I wondered if every character in the game could get its Daft Punk mashup. So I checked (almost) every unit OST, and succeeded in finding a pair for each one.
The songs used to make this mod came from the following albums: Homework, Discovery, Human After All, Alive 2007, Tron Legacy Soundtrack, and Random Access Memories.

I recommend discovering the songs by yourself in the game. Otherwise, you can check the list here[docs.google.com].
You can also listen to them directly on bandcamp[animanatole.bandcamp.com].
You can download them by purchasing the album or by using the link provided in its description.

ATTENTION!
This addon may still be incomplete due to an understaffed team and time constraints. Any constructive feedback from you, the community, in order to aid the development of this mod over time will be greatly appreciated.

This is a voice pack for the starter character Kai, the protagonist with a heart of fire and a woefully empty pocket, fandubbing him and his announcer voice into English! The voice work was done by the talented KoltJolt, most notable for previous roles in GabaLeth video game-based comic dubs.

Additional tuning work and testing was done by Ashuraa.

Please let us know what you think! More creators will be credited as they lend a hand in making this project as good as it can be. You can also find me over on Ko-fi[ko-fi.com] if you want to financially support my community-driven gaming endeavours, but that is unnecessary; I recommend you support everyone else involved before the middleman that is me (even though I also worked hard on this project)!

＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿

Mod Features:

● Cute chibi sprite based on Shirasu Azusa.
● Fully voiced by Risa Taneda (Extracted from the game itself)
● Custom theme song composed by Mitsukiyo | Blue Archive OST 73 - Interface (Hard arrange). Perfectly looped.
● Custom dialogue and description using custom language
● Custom hyper sound effect
● Custom hyper art (from Blue Archive 1st Anniversary Animation PV)
＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿

Known Issues

- All alternative hairs, cosmetics, and colors are disabled since there is no sprite for those.
- Some cosmetics (exp: Kigurumi and Halloween costumes) are bugged because alphamask, I don't really understand how it works and how to make it transparent.
- Some voicelines sound the same (This is due to limited resource)
＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿

Optional
★ In order to use custom dialogue you need to choose ""English (Azusa custom)"" in launcher language setting, this needs to be updated everytime game version is changed, if it bugged choose english instead, I'll try to keep it up to date with game version.

★ You can remove Iru's hyper laser effect by replacing pak file inside your data folder in 100% Orange Juice directory (and yes this needs to be updated everytime the game version is changed, I'll try to keep it updated)
Download Here [drive.google.com]

★ If you want to revert it back, right click on 100% Orange Juice in your steam library, click on local files and then verify integrity of game files

Right on, we're fully charged -- Fire. At. Will!

ATTENTION!
This addon may still be incomplete due to an understaffed team and time constraints. Any constructive feedback from you, the community, in order to aid the development of this mod over time will be greatly appreciated.

This is a voice pack for the starter character Marc, who now peruses the skies alongside her trusty aircraft Red Barrel while speaking English! This also works on the bonus character Marc (Pilot), and her announcer voice. The Little Aviator whom you may recognize from Flying Red Barrel is being dubbed over by TheLuzical, who also stars as Eva Tsunaka in the upcoming visual novel Project: Eden's Garden!

Additional tuning work and testing was done by Ashuraa.

Please let us know what you think! More creators will be credited as they lend a hand in making this project as good as it can be. You can also find me over on Ko-fi[ko-fi.com] if you want to financially support my community-driven gaming endeavours, but that is unnecessary; I recommend you support everyone else involved before the middleman that is me (even though I also worked hard on this project)!

This mod changes the default colors and Hyper art of seven playable characters in 100% Orange Juice. This does cause issues with alternate hair colors and accessories when applied. These issues are not present if characters are switched to a different color as they will revert back to default character. Some DLC is required to play this mod.

- Mixed Poppo is replaced by Egg, and her Hyper is now ""Sassy Child"", artwork provided by ACFan

Due to the limitations and lack of diversity of voice lines (or my non-creative ass), I had to scower to different games and even somehow used some of Hinata's lines from Angel Beats (since they have the same VA.)

The normal UNI voice lines have a project rate of 22050, whilst the BBTag voice lines have a project rate of 48000, changing the project rate causes the sound quality to go bad so if there are times where you feel some lines are quieter/louder than others, I'm sorry.

This is also my first character mod for this game, I didn't know how to work with alternate hair colors so you can't have separate hair and clothing colors.

Also go play Under Night In-Birth and give Kamone money for UNI anime.

Almost all art belongs to the Homestuck Team, I got some sprites from the old mod (some Dancestors sprites). Don't wear costumes or hair colors, I also recommend to deactivate the voices sound, because some characters don't match (For example, Grandpa Harley with the voice of Iru)
Here is the list of changes:
Alte - Kankri Vantas (He becomes stronger when he sacrifices)
Aru - Diamonds Droog (Filler)
Robo ball = Casey (I wanted Casey to be one of the three basic enemies)

Saki - Clubs Deuce (Bomb terrorist)
7Gull - Default Imp (One of the three basic enemies)
Sham - Meulin Leijon (Filler)
Sora - Vriska Serket (She always rolls 8's. But in this weird universe she rolls 6's)
Star Breaker - Caliborn (He just wants to kill everybody)
Suguri - Aranea Serket (Character similar to Vriska)
Suguri 2 - Calliope (She makes everything beautiful with her space powers)

QP dangerous = Feferi (Filler)

Aru scramble = Mom (Filler)
Mark (Pilot) = Obama (I just want to do Obama to put Obama kicking a door as his attack sprite, also throw bombs, this is not a political opinion or attack I'm not from USA and don't know anything about their politics. I'm not including other epilogues characters)

For context for those who don’t follow TRG. Chugga, in almost every instance Rbits is played, calls the card “the buns” to the point where it’s a running gag.

As thanks for TRG getting me into playing 100% Orange Juice, I changed the card Rbits to be based on the joke as well as drew a picture of Chugga holding the rabbits from the former card.

I recommend you stop blocking my way.

ATTENTION!
This addon may still be incomplete due to an understaffed team and time constraints. Any constructive feedback from you, the community, in order to aid the development of this mod over time will be greatly appreciated.

This is a voice pack for the starter character Suguri, changing the character and announcer voice of the speedy, silver-haired savior of the Earth into one in English! This also works on the bonus character Suguri (Ver.2), but does not support Suguri (46 Billion Years). Voiced by Fiery, we are very pleased to be giving this very talented and passionate actress a fine debut into the wild and wacky world of voiceover.

Additional tuning work and testing was done by Ashuraa.

Please let us know what you think! More creators will be credited as they lend a hand in making this project as good as it can be. You can also find me over on Ko-fi[ko-fi.com] if you want to financially support my community-driven gaming endeavours, but that is unnecessary; I recommend you support everyone else involved before the middleman that is me (even though I also worked hard on this project)!

Not compatible with accessories, but that's not too bad since it's just an edit. Supports colors, though your old color combinations might look a bit ugly--I know mine does--and your new ones may or may not look questionable. Hair color corresponds with its clothing color, for example, hair #2 and color #2 are related and intended to be used together. That doesn't mean you can't mix them, but it's just a thing to point out.
Every color alt is a reference. Some are obvious--the Morpho Knight EX color scheme and the Meta Knight skin that literally changes the sword into Galaxia are the most obvious ones--but some are less obvious. One of them is based off of a character from the Kirby light novels, and I bet that you didn't even know those existed until now.
Doesn't come with card art because I can't draw. Reach out to me if you want to draw card art for this. But you probably don't.

This set of pets is entirely different to the current set provided in the 100% Animal Crossing mod, even animals like Goose who is in both packs have separate variant sets.

(Complete list below.)

Have you ever wondered... ""Wow, hair colors sure like to be different from the Unit Colors.""

Well, yeah, me too! That's why I made this mod.

What it does, as stated above, is change all hair colors via hex value editing to match the pattern of each of the main 12 unit colors (so, not counting extras like Rad Poppo, School Outfits and etc.)

Exceptions have been made to most characters, however. What's an exception in this specific situation? A break in the pattern to change one specific color that may conflict with that character's default hair color without altering the main... you get it.

A full list of exceptions can be found by clicking on this text.[pastebin.com]

And no, I won't be adding a picture of every single hair color edited in this page.

Known issues:

- Some halloween hair colors may not match some characters' halloween unit colors.

- Christmas colors don't look very christmas-y, I know. I tried to do White + Red, it sucked most of the time.

- The swimsuit sprites for Yuki, Tomomo and Kai have their gradients swapped from their base sprite. I cannot do anything about this, so you'll have to wait for a patch that fixes this problem.

Wanna change a few hair colors? Think some may not look all that great? Try changing it yourself!

All you need to do is open this mod's mod.txt file and edit the #HEX values seen! Easy, right?

You can find the .txt file in
Steam --> steamapps --> workshop --> content --> (your number) --> 2733532746

This mod currently replaces All unit colors, hairs, cards/hypers and BGM for Nanako, Suguri, Suguri V2, and Sora (Military); as well as removing all accessories for now (I plan on adding accessories at a later date)

All sprites made by Donsian. OCs and their likenesses belong to their respective owners.

----------

Donsi: OC and Hyper art by Donsian (Replaces Nanako)

-Residing in a reality above any other, able to enter and exit worlds as she pleases, Donsi lives as a Part-Time Protaonist; a contract worker whose job is to enter other realities and preserve the balance.
Now, she has entered this world of games under reports of dimensions colliding, and mixing together. With her sword, Dreamweaver by her side, can she uncover the mysteries of this world and restore it to a state of stability?

-BGM: Mind Society, Cyber-Rainforce ( https://cyber-rainforce.net/category/free-music-resource/ )
----------

Hikari: OC and Hyper art by Celja100 (Replaces Suguri)

-On a planet all too familiar... war-torn for eons, Hikari had only known war for most of her life, and was determined to end it. Eventually, She had achieved her goal and settled down, starting a family with her husband Yukito and her young daughter, Suguri.
Suddenly, she had found herself in this world run by dice. While she's in no rush to return, finding the games quite fun in fact. She soon realizes the world is fragmented across space and time; culminating as she finds her daughter, fully grown, staring back at her...

-BGM: Cloudbase, Cyber-Rainforce ( https://cyber-rainforce.net/category/free-music-resource/page/4/ )
----------

Coffgirl: OC and Hyper art by CoffgirlDAZE (Replaces Suguri V2)

-Hibiscus... The flower Coffgirl dons is no mere accessory; it's actually the main portion of her body! This flower girl is quite cheerful in nature, though with a penchant for mischief if food is involved.
Her right arm, through some unknown force, can shift into a Piano Blaster, and instrument for both music and combat (though it isn't very powerful on it's own.)
In this world of dice games, Coffgirl sprouts into action!

-BGM: Believe, Musicnote.jp ( https://www.music-note.jp/bgm/life2.html )
----------

KA-713: OC and Hyper art by Kemonokevin (Replaces Sora [Military])

-From an era before the great war that darkened the sky,
KA-713 is a (self-proclaimed) state-of-the-art assistant AI, based on highly experimental and slightly illegal brain scan technology.
Summoned into the world of dice through some unknown force, she now finds herself surrounded by even more advanced AIs and enhanced humans, though she's eager to step up to the new challenge, as well as decrypting the source of their wondrous powers.

-BGM: Shivers, Netrum & Halvorsen ( Track: Netrum & Halvorsen - Shivers [NCS Release]

Open the individual pak files from this link, open the associated pak files in the Data folder of the game, and select all the contents inside the modded paks and move them into the Data folder’s paks for every pak file that the above link provides. No need to worry about this at first though, just check back here every once in a while for me to update the link.

I’ve modded 100% Orange Juice for four and a half years. It’s all I’ve done. This has been my life. This is all I have.
I released a mod a long time ago, known as Sburb Shindig. Eventually I also started working on a mod known as ""Tou-HouDown"" but I made the mistake about discussing my idea on /v/ and an anon took my idea and made 99% 2hu Sauce... I kept improving on my mod in secret though for the sake of my family who played Orange Juice with me. Every day, I would work tirelessly on something only they could enjoy. I included their favorite fandoms and characters and inside jokes only they would get. You will not understand this mod.
It makes no sense to publish this but why not right? It’s not complete but I was never planning on completing it anyway.

Enjoy my Magnum Opus.",No,Yes,No,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

When history witnesses a great change razgriz reveals itself-first as a dark demon.
As a demon, it uses its power to rain death upon the land, and then it dies.

However, after a period of slumber.
Razgriz returns~
This time, as a great hero

Lyrics:
Champagne flutes and
Dinner suits that
Keep your focus
Away from the cheating hands
Tell me
Does that sexy
Gown say what she's
Got in store for her man?
So we roll the dice,
See where they may fall
Come on, why don't we spin the wheel
See whom it may call
Give into temptation
Win it
Maybe lose it all
Who knows
Where the whims of fate may lead us
Chandeliers and
Decolletes that
Keep your focus
Away from the cheating eyes
Tell me
What's that bow tie
On the card guy
Tell you 'bout his design
So we roll the dice,
See where they may fall
Come on, why don't we spin the wheel
See whom it may call
Give into another vice,
See where it might lead
Come on, let's just enjoy the spice
Life and feel so free
Give into temptation

ATTENTION!
This addon may still be incomplete due to an understaffed team and time constraints. Any constructive feedback from you, the community, in order to aid the development of this mod over time will be greatly appreciated.

This is a voice pack for the character Yuki, the catty leader of QP Shooting's formidable Waruda Gang, letting players take a new perspective on her nefarious personality! The New England flavored voice behind this catty rascal is none other than Jaysen Lynn, up-and-coming talent you may recognize as the voice behind Yui Shishido in the Corpse Party dub!

Additional tuning work, scriptwriting, directing and testing was done by Ashuraa.

Please let us know what you think! More creators will be credited as they lend a hand in making this project as good as it can be. You can also find me over on Ko-fi[ko-fi.com] if you want to financially support my community-driven gaming endeavours, but that is unnecessary; I recommend you support everyone else involved before the middleman that is me (even though I also worked hard on this project)!

Official Soundtrack Swap Mod,Icekong,210.472 MB,Apr 7 @ 10:17pm,N/A,"This mod swaps the 100% OJ characters' themes with a soundtracks from Pizza Tower (+ Sugary Spire / Death Mode OST). Originally my calculation told me that there is enough song in Pizza Tower for every current character to have unique sounding track. Oh boy was I bad at math. Anyways, in the end I had to also borrow songs from other sources like Sugary Spire (fangame of Pizza Tower) and Scoutdigo mod Death Mode. I also had to go into unused soundtracks as well.

Also I know there might be grips with some of the choices for what song got assigned to which character. But I tried my best and it was really hard trying assigned each song. In the end, I hope just being able appreciate Pizza Tower OST in game is enough.

One other thing, I tried my best to loop every song. This is my first time really messing with audacity and trying to loop thing seamlessly. I think I did okay job. But this might be only thing that there might be bugs with. So if there loop that sound really off. Please comment below and I try give it another shot to adjust it.

Thanks to @Sakis_Husband (TheTrueHello) and @lightshadow2209 (Yuvachi) for helping me out picking the songs for each characters.

I do not owe the songs. The songs are credit to each of their artist of their respect game / mod.

""The Eye Is Always Watching You"", is a specimen with a visually female humanoid form, wearing a kind of jacket adapted to be a straitjacket and multiple bandages covering half of what appears to be her face, protruding an ethereal eye, which to specific question, for the specimen, is fully functional.

According to electroencephalogram studies, he is in a kind of constant deep sleep state, as opposed to his autonomic nervous system which remains active most of the time.

Workers with low intelligence test scores who have passed in front of D-06-378's cell mention having seen the ""Eye of the Cosmos"" peering inside, then showing a progressive deterioration in their brains.

All sprites were made by me with the permission of the creators of the individuals' OC's
-------
OC's include (replacing Iru, Ceoreparque, Tomomo, and QP(Dangerous) respectively):

-Tsume (OC and Hyper art done by me), the tough girl with bear ears. She goes around her town, doing odd jobs for whoever will accept her work, tho it may get violent. In the world of OJ, she finds herself frequently finding work with the Waruda, who appreciate her capabilities to get things done, though her attitude could use a little work. (Theme music is ""Monster Rival"", by ISAo. found here: https://dova-s.jp/bgm/play3237.html)

-Toggly (OC by @blannni on twitter, Hyper art by me), A smol creature, usually the assistant to a star obsessed scientist, finds herself stuck in the OJ world. Lost in this world of dice games, and with no direction, she'll gather as many stars as she can to impress her friend ^^ (Theme music is ""Strawberry Pop"", by Shimtone. found here: https://dova-s.jp/bgm/play16644.html)

-Humu Loannou (OC and Hyper art by @WifiDoggo on Twitter), A kind, girl with a love for cooking, despite the quality of her craft. She became a magical girl by working with the sentient hat, Belhemu. Stuck in the world of OJ, she needs to constantly feed Belhemu, or risk her own life as it's next meal. To counteract this, she searches for the best cook in this game world, to improve the quality of her meals, and stave off the ticking clock that is Belhemu. (Theme music is ""Die Lietz Revolution"", by ISAo. found here: https://dova-s.jp/bgm/play12290.html)

-Hello (OC by @Sakis_Husband, Hyper art by @rakkidei, both on twitter) The Creation of Sweet Maker, named after it's first words, Hello is a sentient pudding golem, created to protect Saki's secret ingredients while she's away. He has dedicated his life solely to his creator and will do anything it takes to see her safe (Theme music is ""Defender"", by Cyber Rainforce. found here: https://cyber-rainforce.net/?s=defender&x=0&y=0)

I hope you all enjoy the mod, if enough people rate it well, I'll start working on some of the accessories

If people enjoy this, I can also put my other season animal crossing borders as panel sets. - Please comment if this interests you, if this doesn't get much attention I'll prioritise other projects.

If you wish to use this panel set instead of the standard 100% Animal Crossing panel set, prioritise this mod over 100% AC in the Mods tab on the in game settings - as shown in the final display image.

You're welcome to return at any time.~

ATTENTION!
This addon may still be incomplete due to an understaffed team and time constraints. Any constructive feedback from you, the community, in order to aid the development of this mod over time will be greatly appreciated.

This voice pack breathes new life into Fernet, the princess from the red blimp in the sky! Entitled as she may be, she has her soft spots - especially for Marc. Her English-type voice is provided by the one and only RainOverWater, who is known for her past work on Minecraft and Genshin Impact videos.

Additional tuning work, scriptwriting, directing and testing was done by Ashuraa.

Please let us know what you think! More creators will be credited as they lend a hand in making this project as good as it can be. You can also find me over on Ko-fi[ko-fi.com] if you want to financially support my community-driven gaming endeavours, but that is unnecessary; I recommend you support everyone else involved before the middleman that is me (even though I also worked hard on this project)!

Lyrics:
Everyday I wake up unsure
of the tasks the day will bring
Yesterday's disappointments
keep reminding me
Tomorrow's surely coming
just as sure as the air I breathe
But I know I'll get through it
I have what I need...
I have so far to go
And only heaven knows
The sun keeps shining (Everything is bound to change)
And the wind keeps blowing
But the wide blue sky (Wide blue sky, always the same)
It forever stays the same
I've been finding
that the choice it will make...
That the wide blue sky
that it's never gonna change
But I have so far to go
And only heaven knows
Yes, I have so far to go
Heaven knows
Not one day goes by
Bring back my blue sky
On which I rely
There's hope in the wide blue sky
Wide blue sky...
Blue skies given me so much hope... (repeat x8)

In a world where the everyman can control the elements with the simple point of a wand, Juke aims to entertain with his so-called “acts”. Unfortunately for him, he’s still learning the ropes, so most of his shows end with the audience shoving him into his own top hat.

This mod replaces NoName with my own character, Juke. Pretty much every cosmetic NoName has is modified to be either aligned or redrawn to match Juke’s sprites. Below is a list of changes made for the mod.

Changes (v1.0)
NoName’s base design is now Juke
Character theme is now Black Sewing Box – Quiz Magic Academy (perfect loop)
NoName’s Hyper “Ruler” is changed to Escape Act with custom art.
“Oh My Friend” is changed to Visceral Repayment with custom art.
Unit card art is now changed to have Juke on them.
All alt body colors for NoName have been changed to match Juke’s
All hair colors for NoName have been changed to match Juke’s
All glasses for NoName have been changed to match Juke’s
All hats for NoName have been changed to match Juke’s
Alphamasks are applied for Kigurumis and Pumpkin Head hat

This is probably going to be my most complex OJ project I’ll do. If for nothing else but the fact that NoName has double the sprites most other characters have. I’m really glad I did this because as much as I like NoName’s playstyle and personality, his sprites and theme are a bit iffy for me. I’ll probably do another update in the future if more costumes get added. But it’s going to be a little bit before I do some extra things like touch up Juke’s sprites, design a real Halloween costume instead of Monitor Juke, and create voice lines. I dunno.

Slightly scuffed but I edited the original to loop in-game but it should sound passable. Reasons for other cutting is due to for that in normal game play you miss out on latter parts of it. Removed intro build up, in play testing we found that sometimes you don't even get any of the drums before the theme changes to another. As good as it is (piano intro) it didn't feel right from a gameplay perspective as theme changes can be fast paced.
