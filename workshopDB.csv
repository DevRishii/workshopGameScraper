This mod features the incredible art of community fan favorites Coffgirl and King. One a tried and true legend, and the other a quickly rising star- Both stellar artists and contest winners.

Mod Features:
New character model/unit card art
All colors compatible
All hair compatible
All costumes compatible, some replaced with new ones.

In short- this is the official/complete release, much like a DLC. Everything that has been released at this time is in working order.

Compatibility:
Enhanced Colors for Base Game Characters: The Sora Overhaul needs to be placed higher in the build order priority list to avoid overlap errors with this mod.
Sora’s Sweater: Semi-compatible. You can place it below this mod to keep it working for Sora (M), but it is not compatible with this mod, as it uses the old model. Would love to see a version for this mod, but it was out of scope.

Known visual glitches. Please do not report the following::
Christmas Color has its shoulders chopped when using a nondefault hair color + crown/santa hat. This is a result of how OJ applies alphamask 04/05. Even if the character doesn’t have either alpha, they override alpha 03/09 which causes the error. Subsequently, unfixable until FBF patches it. Happens on other characters (Kyoko, Sora M, etc).
Same as above but with the School Crashers Color. Far less noticeable however.
Christmas Color + Halloween 16’ has the Christmas Color leak behind it. There is no alpha on this hat, so it cannot cover the Christmas color. Using any color with 16’ doesn’t really make much sense in the context of this mod, however.
Blue color with nondefault hair color has a bit of its appearance chopped. Expected behavior as there is no alpha, but hardly noticeable.
Credits:
Coffgirl: 6 bases poses and layers used to make hair alphas
King: 9 Costumes, 3 colors (school, blue, Christmas)
Wanderlust: Commissioner, hair layers, alphamasks, standard colors, project compiler.

I would also like to give Coffgirl and King an additional shoutout. Both were extremely professional and adaptive to my requests, and delivered great work, culminating in this grand mod. I would also like to give a very special thanks to King for the sheer amount of excellent art he produced for this project. He produced an incredible 80 frames of art!!! -despite complications and the unforeseen degree of difficulty of the commission. Thank you both for your hard work and for being wonderful people to work with.

Includes all hair coloring, 90% of unit colors, and some accessories but not all, as some are simply too complex and were planned to be redone. Missing accessories have been replaced with blanks to prevent any and all visual glitches. Originally planned to be a part of a much bigger project (OJ Remixed) to do all the original cast.

If you like this mod, remember to like it in-game, fav it, comment, etc. Thanks & have fun! Likewise, if you find errors, please report them. i try to run as many tests as I can, but its still possible something slipped through.

To Do List:
Christmas color
PJs???
Halloween/RPG Costumes????
Compatibility:
Enhanced Colors for Base Game Characters: The Suguri Overhaul needs to be placed higher in the build order priority list to avoid overlap errors with this mod.

Unlike the Suguri Overhaul mod, this mod uses the same models but uses the heads from 診せる's swimsuit mod and better colors to freshen the appearance. This mod comes with fully working hair colors, unit colors, and accessories. This mod also upgrades the unit card, but does not have different hyper card art.

If you like this mod, remember to like it in-game, fav it, comment, etc. Thanks & have fun! Likewise, if you find errors, please report them. i try to run as many tests as I can, but its still possible something slipped through.

Full change List:
Greatly improved face.
Improved hands on some sprites- particularly the dice throw pose.
Darker pallet used to be more inline with modern characters and less washed out.
Bits have been swapped for the pet catcher bit sprites for consistency. Will match for default, green, yellow, and blue.
Bits are now much more aggressive on attack pose.
Fixed missing hair alphas for hairs 8-12 not present in 診せる's mod.
Christmas color now has colored shoes.
Christmas hat now better fits on Nanako's head.
Pumpkins are now HD to better match new units.
Changed unit card art.
There is now shading in Nanako's Christmas gremlin ear...yeah i dunno its in my notes.
Compatibility:
Enhanced Colors for Base Game Characters: The Nanako Overhaul needs to be placed higher in the build order priority list to avoid overlap errors with this mod.
Nanako Swimsuit & Nyanako: Not compatible, as both overwrite the unit files. Thus you can only use one or the other.

Credits:
Invictus: Coloration/alphas/heavy editing to accessories,sprites,etc.
診せる: Face and hand sprites and most hair alphas. ( https://twitter.com/t3n3bra3 )
Please note that if 診せる asks that this mod be taken down, it will be.

Final note: ""What about new skins?"" Depending on what it is, the mod actually should keep operating without further adjustment on my part, as the character is nearly the same as it was originally. Thus as long as the alphamasks don;t cut anything, new additions should work fresh out of the gate.",No,Yes,No,"2,707",129,"1,767",4

(EDIT 2-25-21) Apparently it's not the only mod I'll ever make, lol

This skin replaces MOST outfit colors and SOME accessories. Currently does not work with custom hair, or the Summer Fernet alt. Certain accessories (pumpkin head, Halloween) do not work. This is my first skin so please be nice to me lol

Totally-from-scratch artwork created me. No bases were used aside from the colors from Rozalin's D4+ in-game spritework. Disgaea 2, Disgaea, Sinful Rose and Rozalin belong to Nippon Ichi Software.

I don't really know if I have any future plans for fixing misc. details, but maybe if enough interest is shown in the project I will. Currently I have plans to redo the Hyper art, but maybe at a later date.

To do list:
- Hyper Art
- Fix colors eventually?

UPDATE 9/19/20 v1.3
Changelog:
- Fixed issues with Cow Kigurumi and RPG outfit.
- Replaced unit card illustration

UPDATE 9/19/20 v1.2
Changelog:
Hair colors now implemented as well as most hats!
Fullbody accessories (such as Halloween outfits) have been omitted so they do not ""glitch"" over the base texture, but are not implemented.
Red/blue and Christmas alt colors now default to the normal color scheme.
Also, Sinful Rose (Instrumental) has been added as BGM! (Big thanks to Vplus for the help)

-Costume (swimsuit suguri; touhouvania design --> has been started on)
-Alter some of the unit colors (especially red/blue) to be more interesting or visually appealing
-Add compatibility with at least some of the accessories

Thanks ソラ for analyzing every single sound effect and doing all the audio editing, it wouldn't have been a thing without her help.

All sound effects have been amplified because at base volume they are very silent, you might want to reduce the volume a bit if you plan to use this, as ソラ probably went a little bit overboard with the amplification.

Feel free to comment if you think certain sound effects are a bit too loud or too silent or you have some better ideas for certain sound effects. In the case of the latter, I would appreciate it if you also tell me the SFX number in Rabi-Ribi (like SFX 063, SFX 247, etc).

This is an idea that has been in the works for at least a few months and is...conveniently now coming out during the 30th anniversary of the series. Totally planned!

This pack, at base, aims to replace most of the basic music you hear in game. This includes and is not limited to:
-Character Themes: all have been replaced
-Some Unique Hyper themes: all but the Special Stage tracks have been replaced
-Unique Board Themes: all have been replaced
-Win Game jingle
-Menu Music

At later points, this pack may cover additional songs such as cutscenes and credits music, potentially other sound effects, along with any other songs I've missed. The pack will also be retroactively updated when more characters or unique songs are added. All songs can also be subscribed to individually as well (they will release some days after the full pack releases). Any issues with the packs, such as volume balance, looping, or otherwise, can be mentioned through commenting on either this page or the individual mod's page.

I'd like to extend a thank you to JhroneKire who helped me with some of the song looping and trimming for the core pack development. I would also like to thank neogandw (he's a great artist, check him out: https://twitter.com/Neogandwatch ) for assisting me in assembling the visual thumbnails for the pack, as this would have taken me ages as a result. Finally, in the event people want to hear my thought process for the pack, I do plan on doing something (either a document or a twitter thread) that goes into detail on all of this. Check my twitter ( https://twitter.com/buckshotboo24 ) for the end results of that.

Thanks for subscribing, and I hope you enjoy the pack!

Ever wanted more Animal Crossing in your life? This mod will replace all characters, cards, field panels, homestops, pets and associated text to make OJ Animal Crossing themed. Now with 282 playable characters!

Select 100% Animal Crossing instead of your language when loading the game to display the Character and Card names and associated text changes. (Apologies to players wanting other languages!)

Contains Animal Crossing reskins for:
- All playable Characters and Character colour variants, with additional clothing colour options under hair menu, and added customisations under accessories.
- All characters have at least 2 alternate characters assigned to their Cow/Tiger Kigu accessory slot, and some costume slots to allow you to play as 278 AC characters, and 4 mod only characters - eg Play as Bruce by selecting Papi's cow kigu costume. If an OJ costume is available for the character then the alternate character will have customisation options there - eg Saki's summer costume adds Cole over Sasha.
- New field spaces and homestops, with QOL updates, larger arrows, more colour variety, clearer text on spaces and unique numbered home panels.
- All playable cards edited, with associated text changes applied to a custom language pack.
- Co-op mode bosses. Bosses have text changes via 100%AC language pack.
- Bounty Hunt summons, bounties and Harbringer replaced, and new bounty quests set by AC characters.
- All pets and pet colour variants added, as extra villagers who travel with you. And an optional mod exists to change out pets for a different selection!
- Various QOL text changes in the 100% AC language option, including easier stat buff displays, an icon indicator for sweet cards, now as sleep cards and turn counts for field events.
- Optional Add-on mods available, changing UI, the arcade, dice, fields, hyper animations, co-op/BH displays, replacing Music, adding panel borders.

This mod will also continue to be updated to add any new DLC characters and event items as and when the game updates. - Usually within 24 hours of the update releasing, as I have many of the files pre-prepared to add now.
The support mod which updates files not available to mod on the steam workshop usually updates within 48 hours of an OJ update.

Additional 100% AC mods:

Changes:
-Krila is now called by her full name, Krilalaris, on her character card (It's official now!) and in the store
-Cuties are now called Sora & Sham (Idols) on the character card and in the store, making it consistent with the Japanese localization where they're called ソラ＆シャム（アイドル）(Sora&Shamu (aidoru) - ""Sora&Sham (Idols)"")
-The names of the Japanese artists are now all in the eastern name order, instead of some names being in the eastern and others in the western order. (It's official now as well!)
-Mimyuu (both regular and Jailbird) and Ceoreparque now only refer to themselves in 3rd person when they actually do so in the Japanese version (which is still a lot but not every time).
-The description of the Cupcake pet now uses degrees Celsius.
-Sweet Breaker is now called Sweebu instead of Sweebo in her campaign and in a few other places. In the Japanese localization her nickname is スイブ - ""Suibu"", which are 2 first characters of the first part of her name: スイート (Suīto, ""Sweet"") and the first character of the second part of her name: ブレイカー (Bureikā, ""Breaker"").

There are currently 57 modified characters, including all the base and most of the DLC characters. I plan to modify the rest of the roster.

As a fan of the former robot duo, and as a regular player of that lovely board game, I wondered if every character in the game could get its Daft Punk mashup. So I checked (almost) every unit OST, and succeeded in finding a pair for each one.
The songs used to make this mod came from the following albums: Homework, Discovery, Human After All, Alive 2007, Tron Legacy Soundtrack, and Random Access Memories.

I recommend discovering the songs by yourself in the game. Otherwise, you can check the list here[docs.google.com].
You can also listen to them directly on bandcamp[animanatole.bandcamp.com].
You can download them by purchasing the album or by using the link provided in its description.

ATTENTION!
This addon may still be incomplete due to an understaffed team and time constraints. Any constructive feedback from you, the community, in order to aid the development of this mod over time will be greatly appreciated.

This is a voice pack for the starter character Kai, the protagonist with a heart of fire and a woefully empty pocket, fandubbing him and his announcer voice into English! The voice work was done by the talented KoltJolt, most notable for previous roles in GabaLeth video game-based comic dubs.

Additional tuning work and testing was done by Ashuraa.

Please let us know what you think! More creators will be credited as they lend a hand in making this project as good as it can be. You can also find me over on Ko-fi[ko-fi.com] if you want to financially support my community-driven gaming endeavours, but that is unnecessary; I recommend you support everyone else involved before the middleman that is me (even though I also worked hard on this project)!

＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿

Mod Features:

● Cute chibi sprite based on Shirasu Azusa.
● Fully voiced by Risa Taneda (Extracted from the game itself)
● Custom theme song composed by Mitsukiyo | Blue Archive OST 73 - Interface (Hard arrange). Perfectly looped.
● Custom dialogue and description using custom language
● Custom hyper sound effect
● Custom hyper art (from Blue Archive 1st Anniversary Animation PV)
＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿

Known Issues

- All alternative hairs, cosmetics, and colors are disabled since there is no sprite for those.
- Some cosmetics (exp: Kigurumi and Halloween costumes) are bugged because alphamask, I don't really understand how it works and how to make it transparent.
- Some voicelines sound the same (This is due to limited resource)
＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿

Optional
★ In order to use custom dialogue you need to choose ""English (Azusa custom)"" in launcher language setting, this needs to be updated everytime game version is changed, if it bugged choose english instead, I'll try to keep it up to date with game version.

★ You can remove Iru's hyper laser effect by replacing pak file inside your data folder in 100% Orange Juice directory (and yes this needs to be updated everytime the game version is changed, I'll try to keep it updated)
Download Here [drive.google.com]

★ If you want to revert it back, right click on 100% Orange Juice in your steam library, click on local files and then verify integrity of game files

ATTENTION!
This addon may still be incomplete due to an understaffed team and time constraints. Any constructive feedback from you, the community, in order to aid the development of this mod over time will be greatly appreciated.

This is a voice pack for the starter character Marc, who now peruses the skies alongside her trusty aircraft Red Barrel while speaking English! This also works on the bonus character Marc (Pilot), and her announcer voice. The Little Aviator whom you may recognize from Flying Red Barrel is being dubbed over by TheLuzical, who also stars as Eva Tsunaka in the upcoming visual novel Project: Eden's Garden!

Additional tuning work and testing was done by Ashuraa.

Please let us know what you think! More creators will be credited as they lend a hand in making this project as good as it can be. You can also find me over on Ko-fi[ko-fi.com] if you want to financially support my community-driven gaming endeavours, but that is unnecessary; I recommend you support everyone else involved before the middleman that is me (even though I also worked hard on this project)!

These issues are not present if characters are switched to a different color as they will revert back to default character. Some DLC is required to play this mod.

Due to the limitations and lack of diversity of voice lines (or my non-creative ass), I had to scower to different games and even somehow used some of Hinata's lines from Angel Beats (since they have the same VA.)

The normal UNI voice lines have a project rate of 22050, whilst the BBTag voice lines have a project rate of 48000, changing the project rate causes the sound quality to go bad so if there are times where you feel some lines are quieter/louder than others, I'm sorry.

This is also my first character mod for this game, I didn't know how to work with alternate hair colors so you can't have separate hair and clothing colors.

Also go play Under Night In-Birth and give Kamone money for UNI anime.

ATTENTION!
This addon may still be incomplete due to an understaffed team and time constraints. Any constructive feedback from you, the community, in order to aid the development of this mod over time will be greatly appreciated.

This is a voice pack for the starter character QP, the unyielding dog-eared pudding lover of QP Shooting fame, fandubbing her and her announcer voice into English! This also works on the bonus character QP (Dangerous). Our hoodie-wearing heroine is portrayed by the energetic and upbeat kylesmigyles, a rising VTuber who does a lot of neat coordinated Re:Zero readings with Studio Reverie!

Additional tuning work and testing was done by Ashuraa.

Please let us know what you think! More creators will be credited as they lend a hand in making this project as good as it can be. You can also find me over on Ko-fi[ko-fi.com] if you want to financially support my community-driven gaming endeavours, but that is unnecessary; I recommend you support everyone else involved before the middleman that is me (even though I also worked hard on this project)!

I recommend you stop blocking my way.

ATTENTION!
This addon may still be incomplete due to an understaffed team and time constraints. Any constructive feedback from you, the community, in order to aid the development of this mod over time will be greatly appreciated.

This is a voice pack for the starter character Suguri, changing the character and announcer voice of the speedy, silver-haired savior of the Earth into one in English! This also works on the bonus character Suguri (Ver.2), but does not support Suguri (46 Billion Years). Voiced by Fiery, we are very pleased to be giving this very talented and passionate actress a fine debut into the wild and wacky world of voiceover.

Additional tuning work and testing was done by Ashuraa.

Please let us know what you think! More creators will be credited as they lend a hand in making this project as good as it can be. You can also find me over on Ko-fi[ko-fi.com] if you want to financially support my community-driven gaming endeavours, but that is unnecessary; I recommend you support everyone else involved before the middleman that is me (even though I also worked hard on this project)!

The art of the Cirno Fumo is drawn by me. Some small sprites are taken from Touhou Hisoutensoku and Touhou 16. Cirno's theme in this mod is also from Touhou Hisoutensoku. And of course, Touhou is owned by Team Shanghai Alice/Zun and i don't own anything (not even a fumo :( )

Not compatible with accessories, but that's not too bad since it's just an edit. Supports colors, though your old color combinations might look a bit ugly--I know mine does--and your new ones may or may not look questionable. Hair color corresponds with its clothing color, for example, hair #2 and color #2 are related and intended to be used together. That doesn't mean you can't mix them, but it's just a thing to point out.
Every color alt is a reference. Some are obvious--the Morpho Knight EX color scheme and the Meta Knight skin that literally changes the sword into Galaxia are the most obvious ones--but some are less obvious. One of them is based off of a character from the Kirby light novels, and I bet that you didn't even know those existed until now.
Doesn't come with card art because I can't draw. Reach out to me if you want to draw card art for this. But you probably don't.

(Complete list below.)

Have you ever wondered... ""Wow, hair colors sure like to be different from the Unit Colors.""

Well, yeah, me too! That's why I made this mod.

What it does, as stated above, is change all hair colors via hex value editing to match the pattern of each of the main 12 unit colors (so, not counting extras like Rad Poppo, School Outfits and etc.)

Exceptions have been made to most characters, however. What's an exception in this specific situation? A break in the pattern to change one specific color that may conflict with that character's default hair color without altering the main... you get it.

A full list of exceptions can be found by clicking on this text.[pastebin.com]

And no, I won't be adding a picture of every single hair color edited in this page.

Known issues:

- Some halloween hair colors may not match some characters' halloween unit colors.

- Christmas colors don't look very christmas-y, I know. I tried to do White + Red, it sucked most of the time.

- The swimsuit sprites for Yuki, Tomomo and Kai have their gradients swapped from their base sprite. I cannot do anything about this, so you'll have to wait for a patch that fixes this problem.

Wanna change a few hair colors? Think some may not look all that great? Try changing it yourself!

All you need to do is open this mod's mod.txt file and edit the #HEX values seen! Easy, right?

You can find the .txt file in
Steam --> steamapps --> workshop --> content --> (your number) --> 2733532746

This mod currently replaces All unit colors, hairs, cards/hypers and BGM for Nanako, Suguri, Suguri V2, and Sora (Military); as well as removing all accessories for now (I plan on adding accessories at a later date)

All sprites made by Donsian. OCs and their likenesses belong to their respective owners.

----------

Donsi: OC and Hyper art by Donsian (Replaces Nanako)

-Residing in a reality above any other, able to enter and exit worlds as she pleases, Donsi lives as a Part-Time Protaonist; a contract worker whose job is to enter other realities and preserve the balance.
Now, she has entered this world of games under reports of dimensions colliding, and mixing together. With her sword, Dreamweaver by her side, can she uncover the mysteries of this world and restore it to a state of stability?

-BGM: Mind Society, Cyber-Rainforce ( https://cyber-rainforce.net/category/free-music-resource/ )
----------

Hikari: OC and Hyper art by Celja100 (Replaces Suguri)

-On a planet all too familiar... war-torn for eons, Hikari had only known war for most of her life, and was determined to end it. Eventually, She had achieved her goal and settled down, starting a family with her husband Yukito and her young daughter, Suguri.
Suddenly, she had found herself in this world run by dice. While she's in no rush to return, finding the games quite fun in fact. She soon realizes the world is fragmented across space and time; culminating as she finds her daughter, fully grown, staring back at her...

-BGM: Cloudbase, Cyber-Rainforce ( https://cyber-rainforce.net/category/free-music-resource/page/4/ )
----------

Coffgirl: OC and Hyper art by CoffgirlDAZE (Replaces Suguri V2)

-Hibiscus... The flower Coffgirl dons is no mere accessory; it's actually the main portion of her body! This flower girl is quite cheerful in nature, though with a penchant for mischief if food is involved.
Her right arm, through some unknown force, can shift into a Piano Blaster, and instrument for both music and combat (though it isn't very powerful on it's own.)
In this world of dice games, Coffgirl sprouts into action!

-BGM: Believe, Musicnote.jp ( https://www.music-note.jp/bgm/life2.html )
----------

KA-713: OC and Hyper art by Kemonokevin (Replaces Sora [Military])

-From an era before the great war that darkened the sky,
KA-713 is a (self-proclaimed) state-of-the-art assistant AI, based on highly experimental and slightly illegal brain scan technology.
Summoned into the world of dice through some unknown force, she now finds herself surrounded by even more advanced AIs and enhanced humans, though she's eager to step up to the new challenge, as well as decrypting the source of their wondrous powers.

-BGM: Shivers, Netrum & Halvorsen ( Track: Netrum & Halvorsen - Shivers [NCS Release]

It is highly recommended to have the following file. It may become outdated with updates but I'll try to keep up with it.

Updated as of April 5, 2022 for some reason:

If this has been outdated due to a new update and I haven’t updated the link for a while, there is a workaround. Open the individual pak files from this link, open the associated pak files in the Data folder of the game, and select all the contents inside the modded paks and move them into the Data folder’s paks for every pak file that the above link provides. No need to worry about this at first though, just check back here every once in a while for me to update the link.

I’ve modded 100% Orange Juice for four and a half years. It’s all I’ve done. This has been my life. This is all I have.
I released a mod a long time ago, known as Sburb Shindig. Eventually I also started working on a mod known as ""Tou-HouDown"" but I made the mistake about discussing my idea on /v/ and an anon took my idea and made 99% 2hu Sauce... I kept improving on my mod in secret though for the sake of my family who played Orange Juice with me. Every day, I would work tirelessly on something only they could enjoy. I included their favorite fandoms and characters and inside jokes only they would get. You will not understand this mod.

Comment if any issues this is my first mod - 2/11/22

Lyrics:
Champagne flutes and
Dinner suits that
Keep your focus
Away from the cheating hands
Tell me
Does that sexy
Gown say what she's
Got in store for her man?
So we roll the dice,
See where they may fall
Come on, why don't we spin the wheel
See whom it may call
Give into temptation
Win it
Maybe lose it all
Who knows
Where the whims of fate may lead us
Chandeliers and
Decolletes that
Keep your focus
Away from the cheating eyes
Tell me
What's that bow tie
On the card guy
Tell you 'bout his design
So we roll the dice,
See where they may fall
Come on, why don't we spin the wheel
See whom it may call
Give into another vice,
See where it might lead
Come on, let's just enjoy the spice
Life and feel so free
Give into temptation

In addition, I added some props, just to let you guys make some adjustments for 12 according to your own preferences.
Of course there are not many accessories currently available, so it still has its limitations.
But I plan to slowly add and tweak them in the future in order to have better experience.

ATTENTION!
This addon may still be incomplete due to an understaffed team and time constraints. Any constructive feedback from you, the community, in order to aid the development of this mod over time will be greatly appreciated.

This is a voice pack for the character Yuki, the catty leader of QP Shooting's formidable Waruda Gang, letting players take a new perspective on her nefarious personality! The New England flavored voice behind this catty rascal is none other than Jaysen Lynn, up-and-coming talent you may recognize as the voice behind Yui Shishido in the Corpse Party dub!

Additional tuning work, scriptwriting, directing and testing was done by Ashuraa.

Please let us know what you think! More creators will be credited as they lend a hand in making this project as good as it can be. You can also find me over on Ko-fi[ko-fi.com] if you want to financially support my community-driven gaming endeavours, but that is unnecessary; I recommend you support everyone else involved before the middleman that is me (even though I also worked hard on this project)!

Official Soundtrack Swap Mod,Icekong,210.472 MB,Apr 7 @ 10:17pm,N/A,"This mod swaps the 100% OJ characters' themes with a soundtracks from Pizza Tower (+ Sugary Spire / Death Mode OST). Originally my calculation told me that there is enough song in Pizza Tower for every current character to have unique sounding track. Oh boy was I bad at math. Anyways, in the end I had to also borrow songs from other sources like Sugary Spire (fangame of Pizza Tower) and Scoutdigo mod Death Mode. I also had to go into unused soundtracks as well.

Also I know there might be grips with some of the choices for what song got assigned to which character. But I tried my best and it was really hard trying assigned each song. In the end, I hope just being able appreciate Pizza Tower OST in game is enough.

One other thing, I tried my best to loop every song. This is my first time really messing with audacity and trying to loop thing seamlessly. I think I did okay job. But this might be only thing that there might be bugs with. So if there loop that sound really off. Please comment below and I try give it another shot to adjust it.

Thanks to @Sakis_Husband (TheTrueHello) and @lightshadow2209 (Yuvachi) for helping me out picking the songs for each characters.

I do not owe the songs. The songs are credit to each of their artist of their respect game / mod.

""The Eye Is Always Watching You"", is a specimen with a visually female humanoid form, wearing a kind of jacket adapted to be a straitjacket and multiple bandages covering half of what appears to be her face, protruding an ethereal eye, which to specific question, for the specimen, is fully functional.

According to electroencephalogram studies, he is in a kind of constant deep sleep state, as opposed to his autonomic nervous system which remains active most of the time.

Workers with low intelligence test scores who have passed in front of D-06-378's cell mention having seen the ""Eye of the Cosmos"" peering inside, then showing a progressive deterioration in their brains.

All sprites were made by me with the permission of the creators of the individuals' OC's
-------
OC's include (replacing Iru, Ceoreparque, Tomomo, and QP(Dangerous) respectively):

-Tsume (OC and Hyper art done by me), the tough girl with bear ears. She goes around her town, doing odd jobs for whoever will accept her work, tho it may get violent. In the world of OJ, she finds herself frequently finding work with the Waruda, who appreciate her capabilities to get things done, though her attitude could use a little work. (Theme music is ""Monster Rival"", by ISAo. found here: https://dova-s.jp/bgm/play3237.html)

-Toggly (OC by @blannni on twitter, Hyper art by me), A smol creature, usually the assistant to a star obsessed scientist, finds herself stuck in the OJ world. Lost in this world of dice games, and with no direction, she'll gather as many stars as she can to impress her friend ^^ (Theme music is ""Strawberry Pop"", by Shimtone. found here: https://dova-s.jp/bgm/play16644.html)

-Humu Loannou (OC and Hyper art by @WifiDoggo on Twitter), A kind, girl with a love for cooking, despite the quality of her craft. She became a magical girl by working with the sentient hat, Belhemu. Stuck in the world of OJ, she needs to constantly feed Belhemu, or risk her own life as it's next meal. To counteract this, she searches for the best cook in this game world, to improve the quality of her meals, and stave off the ticking clock that is Belhemu. (Theme music is ""Die Lietz Revolution"", by ISAo. found here: https://dova-s.jp/bgm/play12290.html)

-Hello (OC by @Sakis_Husband, Hyper art by @rakkidei, both on twitter) The Creation of Sweet Maker, named after it's first words, Hello is a sentient pudding golem, created to protect Saki's secret ingredients while she's away. He has dedicated his life solely to his creator and will do anything it takes to see her safe (Theme music is ""Defender"", by Cyber Rainforce. found here: https://cyber-rainforce.net/?s=defender&x=0&y=0)

I hope you all enjoy the mod, if enough people rate it well, I'll start working on some of the accessories

ATTENTION!
This addon may still be incomplete due to an understaffed team and time constraints. Any constructive feedback from you, the community, in order to aid the development of this mod over time will be greatly appreciated.

This voice pack breathes new life into Fernet, the princess from the red blimp in the sky! Entitled as she may be, she has her soft spots - especially for Marc. Her English-type voice is provided by the one and only RainOverWater, who is known for her past work on Minecraft and Genshin Impact videos.

Additional tuning work, scriptwriting, directing and testing was done by Ashuraa.

Please let us know what you think! More creators will be credited as they lend a hand in making this project as good as it can be. You can also find me over on Ko-fi[ko-fi.com] if you want to financially support my community-driven gaming endeavours, but that is unnecessary; I recommend you support everyone else involved before the middleman that is me (even though I also worked hard on this project)!

- Regarding hats and accessories compatibility, I might not do it since it takes a lot of work and I might just end up making them transparent so you atleast don't end up with a messy looking Majima when playing with other people that uses accessories but even then, making them transparent will also take time since there's a lot of files and renaming involved.

Everyday I wake up unsure
of the tasks the day will bring
Yesterday's disappointments
keep reminding me
Tomorrow's surely coming
just as sure as the air I breathe
But I know I'll get through it
I have what I need...
I have so far to go
And only heaven knows
The sun keeps shining (Everything is bound to change)
And the wind keeps blowing
But the wide blue sky (Wide blue sky, always the same)
It forever stays the same
I've been finding
that the choice it will make...
That the wide blue sky
that it's never gonna change
But I have so far to go
And only heaven knows
Yes, I have so far to go
Heaven knows
Not one day goes by
Bring back my blue sky
On which I rely
There's hope in the wide blue sky
Wide blue sky...
Blue skies given me so much hope... (repeat x8)

In a world where the everyman can control the elements with the simple point of a wand, Juke aims to entertain with his so-called “acts”. Unfortunately for him, he’s still learning the ropes, so most of his shows end with the audience shoving him into his own top hat.

This mod replaces NoName with my own character, Juke. Pretty much every cosmetic NoName has is modified to be either aligned or redrawn to match Juke’s sprites. Below is a list of changes made for the mod.

Changes (v1.0)
NoName’s base design is now Juke
Character theme is now Black Sewing Box – Quiz Magic Academy (perfect loop)
NoName’s Hyper “Ruler” is changed to Escape Act with custom art.
“Oh My Friend” is changed to Visceral Repayment with custom art.
Unit card art is now changed to have Juke on them.
All alt body colors for NoName have been changed to match Juke’s
All hair colors for NoName have been changed to match Juke’s
All glasses for NoName have been changed to match Juke’s
All hats for NoName have been changed to match Juke’s
Alphamasks are applied for Kigurumis and Pumpkin Head hat

This is probably going to be my most complex OJ project I’ll do. If for nothing else but the fact that NoName has double the sprites most other characters have. I’m really glad I did this because as much as I like NoName’s playstyle and personality, his sprites and theme are a bit iffy for me. I’ll probably do another update in the future if more costumes get added. But it’s going to be a little bit before I do some extra things like touch up Juke’s sprites, design a real Halloween costume instead of Monitor Juke, and create voice lines. I dunno.

Slightly scuffed but I edited the original to loop in-game but it should sound passable. Reasons for other cutting is due to for that in normal game play you miss out on latter parts of it. Removed intro build up, in play testing we found that sometimes you don't even get any of the drums before the theme changes to another. As good as it is (piano intro) it didn't feel right from a gameplay perspective as theme changes can be fast paced.

Do note that playing as an Alt character with these options, (equivalent of wearing a cow/tiger kigu with the glasses in OJ) will often lead to graphical overlap as all these accessories are designed to work only with the main character.

バケツヘルム卿について


-センチネル・バケツヘルム卿

定期更新型ゲーム、『騒乱イバラシティ』に登場させている作者のオリジナルキャラクター。
街のヒーローを名乗っており、パワードスーツを用いて戦う巨漢の鎧。

小銃弾までもを跳ね返す強靭な装甲、ジェット噴射によるすさまじいスピードと重量を武器にしたハンマーを武器として扱うが、反面重量や性質上可動域と機動力に劣る。

そのため相手の逃げない正面切っての戦闘や袋小路への追い込みではめっぽう強いものの、単純に逃げられた場合警官や他のヒーローを頼るしかないという欠点を抱える。ファンいわく""ガチンコ向き""。

Important: If you are an Animal Crossing fan then I recommend checking out Jinglefruit's ""100% Animal Crossing Juice"" mod! It's a mod that changes the visuals of things like: all characters, cards, boards (panels), and Homemarks! Most of my ""requests"" are actually from Jinglefruit so it will mesh really nicely since we are working together on a lot of the track decisions.

This results in people bleeding for a longer time after an injury, easy bruising, and an increased risk of bleeding inside joints or the brain. Those with a mild case of the disease may have symptoms only after an accident or during surgery. Bleeding into a joint can result in permanent damage while bleeding in the brain can result in long term headaches, seizures, or a decreased level of consciousness.
There are two main types of haemophilia: haemophilia A, which occurs due to low amounts of clotting factor VIII, and haemophilia B, which occurs due to low levels of clotting factor IX. They are typically inherited from one's parents through an X chromosome carrying a nonfunctional gene. Rarely a new mutation may occur during early development or haemophilia may develop later in life due to antibodies forming against a clotting factor. Other types include haemophilia C, which occurs due to low levels of factor XI, and parahaemophilia, which occurs due to low levels of factor V. Acquired haemophilia is associated with cancers, autoimmune disorders, and pregnancy. Diagnosis is by testing the blood for its ability to clot and its levels of clotting factors.",No,Yes,No,27,1,1,N/A

My hope is that this can become a one-stop shop for any Tomomo (Casual) player to get the combination of mods they want to have a personalised gameplay experience!

For the discerning (Casual) player
Expect a lot of these items to be exclusively useful to Tomomo players!
Expect some of these items to be exclusively useful to Tomomo (Casual) players who actually only play Tomomo (Casual)...

Anyway, I'll be making some stuff! I wanna play with goofy graphics and stuff, so I'll be publishing what I make!

Mods that have variations of the same category of mod will be given the exact same name before the hyphen. These will most likely not work together and only one will take priority. I'll do my best to make sure that combinations of mods here work together! Please, feel free to send me a message if you have any critique you feel can improve my art!

Some of these mods work for any charater, what makes them part of a (Casual) collection?
Well, I plan to use them, and I only play Tomomo (Casual), ergo...

Why Tomomo (Casual)?
Why not Tomomo (Casual)?

How frequently do you work on mods?
Ah, you know~ At times~
It gets pretty rough to maintain focus and motivation for so long, but I'm doing my best!
Sometimes I just wanna sleep all day, yaknow...

How much of other people's work do you plan to plagiarise?
I don't plan to plagiarise anyone's work, but if I do it by circumstance, oopsie~
I'm just kinda spitballing any idea that comes to my head here!

Why do you split all your mods into so many separate pieces?
So that you can take what you want, and leave what you don't want!
It also makes it easier for me to edit a single one, and lets you order them differently in the load priority!
On the other hand, it does make the ingame list a bit long... But that's the tradeoff I accept!",No,Yes,No,61,3,3,N/A

The moment you remove the blindfold, this system collapses, as you are making a measurement as to whether or not a guy or a girl is sucking you off; whether or not it's gay.

If you are not playing or have already completed the scenario, please disable this mod in the in-game mod manager. To do this: in the game menu go to ""extras"", then select ""installed mods"" and find this scenario and disable it. If you don't do this, you may encounter bugs with e-mails.

Description
This scenario is based on facts and it is very advanced.

-We added 2 calls with real voices.
-16 new incidents (explosions, evacuation of buildings or streets, collapses, traffic management etc).
-New e-mails (from the supervisor).
-The scenario lasts three duties (each duty has its own scenario).
-The weather and the location of the attack is the same as in reality.
-English and Polish.

To make the gameplay more interesting, we added American Mod Pack and Mega Compile.
Watch the trailer to see the scenario.

The attack of September 11, 2001 was a series of four terrorist attacks. Terrorists took control of the planes. Two of the hijacked planes crashed the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York, which collapsed after several dozen minutes. The total number of injured is 6291 and 2996 victims including terrorists.

We know that the event of September 11, 2001 is a huge tragedy, and we're sorry too, but the scenario is only intended to allow the player to play during a terrorist attack.
We wish you a nice game!

Warnings
If you are not playing or have already completed the scenario, please disable this mod in the in-game mod manager. To do this: in the game menu go to ""extras"", then select ""installed mods"" and find this scenario and disable it. If you don't do this, you may encounter bugs with e-mails.

Mods are disabled in workshop scenarios due to possible breakage. Mods are disabled not by me and not only in this scenario.

The roadmap for next scenarios is on our discord server.

FROM US:
We know very well that this is not the best place to promote our groundbreaking mod (or even you can say fan DLC), but we really care about reaching people with our work. We want to improve the quality of the game and support their life as long as possible. We have been working on Fierce: Fan Expansion since June 2021. The mod will be fully developed (according to assumptions) in late 2023, but so far it is only available to backers. If you want to help, please share the mod with your friends.

After most of our successful smaller projects like European Mod Pack, Mega Compile or What is Your Emergency, we decided to take another, but this time, a huge step. We hope you will like it too. :)

Our backers have access to the beta tests where they can play Fierce: Fan Expansion. The support link is below.
Unfortunately, Fierce: Fan Expansion will not be made available on Steam due to restrictions. You will only be able to download it on our website.

ABOUT FIERCE: FAN EXPANSION:
Huge fan DLC to 112 Operator. The content includes new mechanics, dream features, lots of new incidents, events, calls, and more! Now deal with incredibly serious disasters! Equip your units with new equipment and send them to new events.

This mod is a second life for 112 Operator. It adds everything we can to make your experience as good as possible. The mod is created in constant contact with our community, which gives us ideas or required corrections. We believe that all this will allow the player to play with a new feeling with a new adventure.

In constant contact with the community and the analysis of their needs, we can easily find the most important and popular requirements. With each update, we add more and more changes that significantly improve the gameplay of 112 Operator. Our mission is to make the game real and add enough content to keep the game full of fun.
Thanks to the game developers and their help for us, modders, we can fully implement our plans. Without the help we need so much, we probably wouldn't be able to enjoy such a large project now that it grows stronger every day.

The standout features of this powerful mod are new mechanics and new features that will diversify and make it easier to manage all this mess! The list of all changes would not fit on one page and it would take several years to read it! That is why we only show the ""coolest"" ones.

Your mission is to save lives, remember!

Are you missing a few options in the game to facilitate a gameplay? How about new mechanics?
Brand 60 new events. Eliminate organized crime groups, save residents after a major hurricane or flood, or even a sandstorm!
Do you love moments at the family table? Unfortunately, this year you have a duty. Christmas, New Year's Eve or Halloween on duties is the norm!
Even more calls, yes! 40+ new professional connections. Experience new situations in your city.
New types of crew members? Don't forget that negotiators, rescue dogs or police technicians will be useful to you!
How about the new weather? Do you like hail or fog? Neither are we, but you can encounter it!
50 new equipment & gears (chemical/diving suit, SMG, ballistic shield, flashlight or binoculars).
Receive e-mails from the media about the murder of an innocent black boy by a police officer. 300 new e-mails.
Dispatchers are more effective! They are real helpers.
New design of the European Mod Pack and American Mod Pack mods. Buy new and refreshed units and increase a efficiency of services. When installing the mod, choose which units you want in your game, American or European.
Chernobyl scenario, what do you say? New Soviet vehicles, real connections with voices, all in a way that best represents that event.
Dozens of new objectives! Set speed or sobriety measurements and catch road pirates!
Play a new fan campaign in the Polish city, Gdańsk.
Special operations! Create real squads, equipped with the heaviest new equipment possible, and face with well barricaded terrorists in-side of the bank. It's not as easy as you think.
Road accidents become realistic with Fierce: Fan Expansion. There are more of them, and tasks of firefighters also include: vehicle stabilization, battery disconnection, cleaning up oil stains.
Do you like mystery? We too! How about implementing murders, investigations or improving game kidnappings? Find the real criminal out of 20 cases.
About 500 new incidents that can happen in your city or even country. Not all incidents are possible in every country in the world.
Fires are a real threat to your residents now. Dispatch heavy trucks, tanks and helicopters to put out fires.

Water, chemical or high-altitude rescue - development of divisions in the fire brigade. Create a special crew with specialized equipment.
Search are not just incidents, it is even national events where hundreds of people are involved in search!
Are you missing more backup options? Is 50 enough for you?
More incident tasks! Don't you prefer to know everything and see the smallest tasks your people do? Now we have added hundreds of new tasks to solve. This increases the realism!
Stop terrorists and their attempted attacks at train stations, airports or concerts.
Open a drug department in your police station. Seek drug dealers or break up organized crime groups wanted all over the world!
Investigate mass fires and solve arson. Arrest the arsonists!
There may be problematic people at incidents. They can sometimes be armed, and their presence is very rare. In such cases, the police is often needed.
Recommendations and procedures are special help for a player from a supervisor. This will tell you how to send units or what is missing from emergency services.
New possibilities of predefined squads. This will speed up purchases.
A player earns more money.
Improved DLCs: Water Operation, Pandemic Outbreak, The Last Duty. We strive to increase realism and add incidents, events, etc
How about a unique soundtrack created by Chaoswalker?
Will over 150,000 new names and surnames increase randomness?
A small but significant change - ambulances only have one place for patients. No more freaks.

Did you ever feel like you are short on money all the time? When you want to buy a helicopter or boat, you need to work 3-4 days, and even so, you can't buy any other equipment or build any facilities because you just don’t have enough money.

This mod will solve this problem, somehow.

Basically, this mod will decrease the price of any vehicles, including 2 DLCs vehicles, like boats or facility vehicles. It’s not brainless to decrease the price, but with thoughtful adjustment, it makes the vehicles you usually don’t buy cheaper than others. For example, pursuit car, usually I just don’t buy it because it's just too expensive, in this mod it will definitely be affordable. And I make every type of same level units stay in the same price, like basic police car, 2 types of ambulance cars and 2 types of fire trucks.

The major focus of this mod is that making players could buy most equipment for most units, and try some facilities as the game should be. When players won’t be tied by amazing high price vehicles, they will try to make different units special, like buying armor for SWATs, and buy computers or handcuff for patrol police. If you play original games, you just usually don’t have money to do that.

I want to adjust equipment and facilities too, but unfortunately, not like vehicles’ configuration, the equipment and facilities are not able to adjust by txt files. And I fail to find any way to change that, it probably builds in with the original game, so no easy way to modify that. If you know how to change the property of equipment and facilities, please leave a comment.

This mod will NOT work with the mods change the SAME original vehicles’ property, like price, move speed, etc. It could work fine with the mods that add new vehicles, though this mod will NOT change the price of other mod’s vehicles.

This mod will decrease the difficulty of the game, so if you are a hardcore player, maybe it’s not for you. This mod is for people who want to buy more units, equipment, and facilities.

I did not modify too much data, so it should be no possible bugs at all.

可负担的载具

你有没有觉得自己一直很缺钱？当你想买一架直升机或船的时候，你可能需要工作3-4天，即使如此，你也不能购买任何其他设备或建造任何设施，因为就是没钱。

这个Mod将以某种方式解决这个问题。

基本上，这个Mod将降低所有载具的价格，包括2个DLC车辆，如船只或设施载具，并且不是无脑降低价格，而是经过仔细思考的调整，让你通常不会购买的载具相对更便宜。例如，警用跑车，我原来一直不买它，因为它太贵了，在这个Mod里玩家肯定可以负担得起。另外，我让每一种同级别的单位都保持相同的价格，比如基本警车、两种救护车和两种消防车，都是一个价钱。

这个Mod最重要的点是让玩家可以为大多数单位购买大多数的装备，尝试建造一些设施，就像这个游戏本应设计的一样。当玩家不会被价格惊人的载具束缚时，就应该会尝试让不同的单位变得各有特色，比如为特警队购买盔甲，为巡逻警察购买电脑或手铐。如果是原版的游戏，玩家通常没有钱去做这样的事。

我也想调整装备和设施的价钱，但遗憾的是，与载具配置不同，装备和设施无法通过txt文件进行调整。我找不到任何方法来改变这一点，它可能是融入在原版游戏里的，所以没有简单的方法来修改它。如果谁知道如何更改装备和设施的属性，请在评论区里留言。

这个Mod不能和改变相同原始载具属性的Mod一起使用，如价格、移动速度等。它可以与添加新载具的Mods一起用，但这个mod不会改变其他Mod载具的价格。

这个Mod会降低游戏的难度，所以如果你是一个硬核玩家，可以忽略这个Mod。这个Mod是为那些想购买更多的单位，装备和设施的人。

我没有修改太多的数据，所以应该没有任何可能的Bugs。",No,Yes,No,"5,862",105,"2,710",4

The scenario is based on real events , which of course is the coronavirus pandemic.
Coronavirus Mod incidents corrected and updated have been added to the scenario to make the gameplay more interesting and meaningful. We removed incidents where there were many people to make it realistic. We spent a lot of time on it and we hope you will like it. Have a nice game!

In 2020, the world was hit by the coronavirus pandemic, which affected all countries in the world, but Italy was one of the countries most affected. A ban on movement, fear, many deaths and stopped health care - this is what happened to Rome, the capital of Italy.

Description
Lots of people wanted to see it in the game. From now on, you can only play with the police and EMS without any problems! The mod also includes Mega Compile, Events Pack and Terrorist Pack incidents for gameplay improvements. We wanted to create a mod only for the police in the beginning, but it doesn't work.
Medical incidents are only about 1/3 of all incidents.

This is one of the most time consuming mods for 112 Operator we've ever made. We spent a lot of time making everything perfect. We hope you like it.
Have a nice game, Operators! :)

Warnings
The mod doesn't work in the campaign and scenarios. In future updates we will try to do that for the campaign as well.
The mod is compatible with DLC Facilities, Water Operations and Pandemic Outbreak, but not with DLC The Last Duty and mods from other modders. If modders want compatibility with this mod, please let us know.
After disabling the mod, do not use save where the mod was enabled, it will break save.
Please read the instruction, which is very important.

The mod may still contain small bugs. Remember to report them to us immediately. Take a screen and contact us in the discussion (at the bottom), on discord or via e-mail (rescuemodteam112@gmail.com).

The roadmap for the next mods is on our discord server!

Installation Guide:
1. Disable any mods (incidents, calls) in the mod manager. Only vehicle mods and scenarios made by Rescue Mod Team can remain. Mod Manager - Main Menu > Extras > Installed Mods.
Mods that work with this: European Mod Pack, American Mod Pack, British Units Mod, Military Mod, Various Units (European or American), Old Vehicles, Unrecognizable World. Other mods will break this mod and won't work properly.
2. Create a new save.
3. When creating the new game, set 80% (or 90%) incidents on the slider. You can also turn off calls (because there will be few of them), but you don't have to.

Additional: We recommend using this, less risk of errors when playing. If you don't want objectives for fire department and only gears for the police and EMS is available, do this:
4. Find a mod: C:\...\steamapps\workshop\content\793460\2444035355.
5. Copy the folder ""Operator 112_Data"".
6. Paste it to the game folder. To find the game folder: right button on 112 Operator in the library > properties > local files > browse.
Don't load other saves while the mod is enabled!

How to disable the mod?
1. Disable ""Be Only Police & EMS"" mod in the mod manager. Main Menu > Extras > Installed Mods

Additional:
2. Go to the game folder: right button on 112 Operator in the library > properties > local files > browse.
3. Operator 112_Data > StreamingAssets > Story_Module.
4. Delete ""storyModules_freegame"" and ""storyModules_water_freegame"".
5. Verify integrity of game files. Right button on 112 Operator in the library > properties > local files > verify integrity of game files.

Known problems:
1. I can buy a fire truck. - We can't change some things if you are using other mods.
2. There are fire stations on the map. - It is not possible to delete stations.
3. Fire trucks can't move! - It's not a bug. This is to discourage you from buying fire trucks, because you only have to deal with the police and medics.
4. The fire department is still required in the incident descriptions. - It's just a matter of descriptions. The fire department is not required on site.",No,Yes,No,"4,453",62,804,N/A

Description
The scenario is based on real events. Mod adds new incidents such as protests (copied and edited from Events Mod).
The women's strike scenario is ideal for players who like to manage police forces during protests. During the three days, you have to do well and keep everyone safe. The scenario is very refined and interesting, so that everyone can enjoy and get the best experience!

On October 30, 2020, there was one of the largest protests in over a dozen years in Poland. Women were against the tightening of abortion laws in Poland. About 100,000 people went on strike in Warsaw that day.

We wish you a nice game!

Warnings
The scenario requires DLC Facilities and mods are disabled. Mods are disabled in workshop scenarios due to possible breakage. Mods are disabled not by me and not only in this scenario.

The roadmap for next scenarios is on our discord server.

What Does This Mod Add?
- New Police, Fire & Medical Incidents
- 41 New Incidents (This mod adds many sub-types and variants of a single incident, to keep things interesting)
- 10 New Vehicles
- Highly Detailed and Accurate to the Law After Action Reports (I really want reading those to be fun for the player)
- Complex Incidents (Timers and scripts help make incidents more complex & unique, progress over time and react to certain situations).

About this Mod
This mod is designed by an Australian, a Programmer (Experienced in Modding and Unity Game Design) and an Australian Accredited Rescue Operator. Elements are been added with my own experience as an emergency first responder in mind.
This mod aims to add Australian elements to the game from similar incidents based on AU law, Australian Service Vehicles and 000 emergency calls. Anyone anywhere can add these though to add more content to their game.
I've aimed to try and always keep people guessing, I want every incident that looks the same to have the chance to throw something new at the player. This has been done through incident sub-types (these act and look like a normal incident but when you arrive they can be very different). This mod is designed to realistically reflect Australian crimes and emergencies as well as accurate costs (including fines). It is intended to fill the void in the sense and make things like shootings a lot less common compared to speeding or driving offences.

Elements added by this mod are normally rare, I have tried to realistically match the real life Australian statistical chance of the player having one of the incidents in this mod. They are also less often seen as I do not want this mod to drown out the stock incidents or other mods, rather compliment them and feel apart of the game.
Please note however, After Action Reports & Calls are designed for Australia and make reference to Australian organisations and laws. This may conflict with how you may enjoy the game.


Roadmap:
- Continue to Add More Incidents (Police, Fire and Medical are all planned)
- Add Fully Voice Acted '000' Calls (These calls will be structured to blend into the game and the 112 Operator voice actor and have full English voice acting support)
- Add more Australian Service Vehicles



Compatibility
On Going Games:
- Safe to add to an ongoing game
- It will cause issues if removed from an existing save (consider starting a new game to see if you are happy with the content).

Compatibility
No issues with existing mods.

Integrated Compatibility:
None at the moment.

Buffed numerous underperforming vehicles, including even bycicles.
Helicopters can now pursue moving targets, albeit they do so slowly, so are not ideal for it.
Varying weather resistances, big helicopters (police transport and especially fire) are now harder to ground, quads can be used during blizzards.
For feedback just comment below or open a discussion if you can't (for you family share users)

Compatibility:
It probably won't be compatible with any other mod adjusting existing vehicles, but those adding new ones should be fine. Icon changes should work fine though, well except for the new vehicles.

警告2：英语并非这个Mod创作者的母语。如果您对这个Mod有任何意见或者建议，请用英文或者中文发送电子邮件到marcus.daskalos@outlook.com。
简介：
任何汉语使用者都会发现112 Operator中预设的汉语姓名滑稽而可笑。
Jutsu Games简单地复制了许多中国演员、歌手的名字，此外甚至还有中国古代唐朝（7-10世纪）的诗人的名字。
然而，现实中的中国人往往会避免使用著名人物、政治家和祖先的名字，作为对他们的尊重。
这个Mod彻底重制了112 Operator的汉语姓名列表。现在它包含超过300个汉语人名和821个汉语姓氏。大部分姓氏来自《百家姓》，这是一部成书于北宋时期的中国古书，记载了许多姓氏。
所有人名都符合1950年代以来的起名习惯，制作者已经将非常具有特定时代背景的人名除去，以免出现小孩子使用“援朝”或者“文革”这样的名字。

Warning 1: This mod will not automatically take effect after subscription. The content in the Mod folder (should be located under Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\793460) must be overwritten to the 112 Operator game root directory. It is highly recommended that you back up the original file (the default file is Steam\steamapps\common\112 Operator\Operator 112_Data\StreamingAssets\Names\CN.xml).
Warning 2: English is not the mother tongue of the creator of this mod. If you have any comments or suggestions on this mod, please send an email to marcus.daskalos@outlook.com in English or Simplified Chinese. No other language is supported.
Introduction:
Any Chinese user will find the Chinese name preset in 112 Operator funny and ridiculous.
Jutsu Games simply copied the names of many Chinese actors and singers, and even the names of poets from the Tang Dynasty (7th-10th centuries) in ancient China.
However, in reality Chinese people tend to avoid using the names of famous people, politicians and ancestors as a respect for them.
This Mod completely reproduced the Chinese name list of 112 Operator. Now it contains more than 300 Chinese names and 821 Chinese surnames(most of the surnames comes from The Book of Family Names, an ancient book written in Northern Song Dynasty, recorded many surnames).
All names are in line with the naming convention since the 1950s. The producer has removed names with very specific era backgrounds to prevent children from using names like ""援朝(means Aid Korea, commonly used by people born during the Korean War)"" or ""文革(means Cultural Revolution, commonly used by people born during the Proletarian Cultural Revolution era)"".",No,Yes,No,744,21,227,N/A

112 Operator,793460,https://steamcommunity.com/app/793460/workshop/,Items,264,More Realistic and Faster Vehicles,J. Garnet,0.045 MB,"Feb 1, 2021 @ 2:19am","Feb 2, 2021 @ 6:00pm","I noticed that a 25 minute drive in real life took 4 hours in game, and that some things that would seem to make sense (like quad bikes having a search bonus) were not reflected in the game. So, I created this mod to balance it out.

In general, vehicle speeds are 2x the normal speed, just like the original ""SpeedMod"" in the workshop. I also tweaked some vehicle attributes. Below is a complete list of changes:

<!-- FIRE UNITS -->
<!-- Speed: All units had speed doubled except for the quad and the ladder.
Quad speed stayed the same. Ladder top speed was increased from 80 to 180 instead of just being doubled to 160.
Quad acceleration was increased by 2, ladder acceleration decreased by 1. -->
<!-- Upkeep costs: All units except helicopters had upkeep divided by four (4). Helicopter upkeep was halved. -->
<!-- Quad attributes were edited as a search bonus of 0.5 added, offroad speed now matches normal max speed, and it is no longer immobilized by rain or snow because it is an all-terrain vehicle. -->

<!-- MEDICAL UNITS -->
<!-- Speed: Max speed doubled for all units.
Rescue ambulance, fly car, and transport ambulance acceleration attributes were increased by 1. -->
<!-- Upkeep: Costs were divided by 4 for all except heli. Heli upkeep halved. -->
<!-- Attributes: The fly car was given 1.0 bonus for injured to act as a supervisor vehicle.
""Tall"" work bonus was added to helis.
Medical Fly Car transport ability was removed.
Transport van now only transports 2, the same as the rescue van. -->
<!-- Other: Medvan and medcar prices were swapped, including upkeep costs. -->

<!-- POLICE UNITS -->
<!-- Speed: All max speeds doubled, with additional +40 for the pickup truck.
Motorbike acceleration increased by 3, polpickup by 1.
Bicycle acceleration decreased by 10. -->
<!-- Upkeep: Same as others. All upkeep costs were divided by 4 except for helis, which were divided by 2. -->
<!-- Attributes: Polbike and unmarked car search bonus of 0.5 added.
Visibility reduced to 0 for polbike and bicycle to help with proactivity.
Traffic speed increased for the motorbike, so it goes 80% of it's top speed in traffic jams instead of 50%.
Armour increased to 20% for polpickup.
SWAT Van transport seats reduced to 0 and patrols set to false. Setting this to false doesn't seem to do anything, though.
Tall bonus added to helis. -->
<!-- Other: Polpickup price increased to 50,000. -->

ADDED VEHICLES:
""Personally owned vehicles"" were added. This means that the team member is driving the car that they personally own. It offers zero work bonus and goes a lot slower than other vehicles, but can be useful for things like staging medics at a concert or having ""volunteer firefighters"" going to calls in their own vehicles.

A ""fire command pickup"" was added which is the fire equivalent of the Fly Car. It offers no bonuses but goes fast.

A ""Ladder Crew"" was added, which is just the default ladder truck with four seats. It uses the default ladders image. The default ladder truck's image was then changed to reflect the fact that it only has two seats.

Finally, a ""quint"" was added. A quint is somewhat of a cross between a ladder and an engine. It features a small bonus to both ""tall"" and ""fire"", and carries more water than a ladder but less than the firetruck.

투슬리스(나이트퓨리)가 여러분을 도와드립니다!
( 이 버전은 약간의 치트 요소가 들어가있습니다 )

* The Last Duty DLC 문제 *
Last Dury에서 나오는 좀비무리들을 air, 항공유닛만으로는 붙잡기만 하고
수색 및 사살 임무를 진행하지 못해서 못 끝내는 경우가 확인되었습니다
따라서 air와 road 유닛으로 두개로 따로 분배하였습니다
좀비 DLC 사용시에는 road(지상) 유닛을 사용해주시길 바랍니다


투슬리스는 서비스를 제공할 준비를 마치고 대기중입니다

투슬리스가 제공할 서비스 리스트
=====================================================
* 경찰, 소방, 의료 서비스
* 어디든지 날아갈 수 있는 비행 모드
* Last Duty DLC에서는 지상 모드 유닛 사용 권장함.(비행유닛은 좀비 사살 불가)
* 든든한 여러분의 팀원 보호제공
* 범죄자(거칠게)와 환자(포옹) 상태로 수송 지원
* 투슬리스는 수 많은 물고기를 필요로 합니다. 따라서 수 많은 돈이 필요합니다
( 이 버전은 약간의 치트 요소가 들어가있습니다 따라서 유지비용이 높습니다
해당사항에 대해 건의사항이 있다면 댓글을 남겨주세요 )
=====================================================


( 모드 정보 )
* 경찰 비행모드에서 인 게임과 달리 도주하는 범죄자를 잡을 수 있습니다
( 인게임에서는 헬기가 도주하는 범죄자 못잡고 추적만 가능함 )
* The Last Duty DLC로 인해 Air유닛은 좀비무리를 추적만하고 수색 및 사살을 못하는 경우가 발생되어
지상 차량 모드와 공중 유닛 두개로 분리하였습니다
* 경찰관 알파 : 경찰 탑승 4명, 구금 탑승 6명 제공
* 비행관 알파 : 경찰 탑승 4명, 구금 탑승 6명 제공
* 응급요원 알파 : 응급요원 탑승 4명, 환자 탑승 6명 제공
* 소방관 알파 : 소방관 탑승 4명 제공




좀비 DLC 테스트 결과

Air 및 water road 유닛은 좀비무리 제압 못함
따라서 road와 air 유닛으로 따로 분리함

지원 - 군부대(-20 공공질서 소모)
계엄령 군인차량 최고속도 140 방어 0.95

DLC 지급되는 차량 순서
계엄령 군인차량(험비) 최고속도 140 방어 0.95
군용 수송 차량(2.5톤트럭) 최고속도 160 방어 0.85
군용쿼드(2인 오토바이)*2 최고속도110 방어 0.3
전술 장갑차(총기거치한 험비) 최고속도120 방어0.95

방어력 차이도 없는데 전술 장갑차는 왜 속도가 더 느려지게 해났는지 이해안되는 밸런스

시스템 마비되면 지원 부르는것 또한 안되기때문에 군대차량은 모드로 변경 안하는것으로 결정하였습니다

警告2：这个Mod不会在订阅后自动生效。必须将Mod文件夹（应当位于Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\793460/2388425106下）中的内容覆盖到112 Operator游戏根目录。非常建议您备份原文件（默认的文件是Steam\steamapps\common\112 Operator\Operator 112_Data\StreamingAssets\Names\KR.xml）。
警告3：英语并非这个Mod创作者的母语。如果您对这个Mod有任何意见或者建议，请用英文或者中文发送电子邮件到marcus.daskalos@outlook.com。

以谚文书写的朝鲜姓名对非朝鲜语使用者来说是难以识读的。这个Mod将其替换为以拉丁字母拼写的朝鲜语。

也许我可能还会制作一个朝鲜姓名重制Mod，并且它将会以全汉字的形式发布。因为任何一个朝鲜民族的文明人都应当掌握使用汉字的能力。

Warning 1: This is not a remake mod. It simply replaces the original Korean name in the game with the Korean spelled in Latin letters.
Warning 2: This mod will not automatically take effect after subscription. The content in the Mod folder (should be located under Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\793460) must be overwritten to the 112 Operator game root directory. It is highly recommended that you back up the original file (the default file is Steam\steamapps\common\112 Operator\Operator 112_Data\StreamingAssets\Names\KR.xml).
Warning 3: English is not the native language of the creator of this mod. If you have any comments or suggestions on this mod, please send an email to marcus.daskalos@outlook.com in English or Chinese.

Korean names written in Hangul are difficult for non-Korean speakers to read. This mod replaces it with Korean spelled in Latin letters.

Maybe I will make a Korean Names Rework mod later, and that will be released in Chinese Characters form.

Because I think every civilized Korean is supposed to have the ability to use Chinese Characters.",No,Yes,No,188,0,11,N/A

警告2：英语并非这个Mod创作者的母语。如果您对这个Mod有任何意见或者建议，请用英文或者中文发送电子邮件到marcus.daskalos@outlook.com。

Warning 1: This mod will not automatically take effect after subscription. The content in the Mod folder (should be located under Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\793460) must be overwritten to the 112 Operator game root directory. It is highly recommended that you back up the original file (the default file is Steam\steamapps\common\112 Operator\Operator 112_Data\StreamingAssets\Names\JP.xml).
Warning 2: English is not the mother tongue of the creator of this mod. If you have any comments or suggestions on this mod, please send an email to marcus.daskalos@outlook.com in English or Simplified Chinese. No other language is supported.

描述：
简单地重制了游戏中的日本姓名。
制作这个Mod出于和中文姓名重制Mod相似的原因。此外还有一个原因是，原版游戏中的日本姓名是以汉字和假名书写的，这使它很难被非日语使用者识别，阅读和记住。
重制的日本姓名文件包括73个男名，89个女名和128个姓氏，全部用日语罗马字书写。 我相信这样会更容易识别，阅读和记住。
可能将来还会制作一个汉字版本，供汉语、朝鲜语和日本语使用者使用。

Description:
Simply reworked Japanese Names in Game.
For Similiar Reason with Chinese Names Rework Mod. In addition, Japanese names written in Kanji and Kana is hard to recognize, read and remember.
Reworked Japanese Names file includes 73 Male Names, 89 Female Names and 128 Surnames, all written in Roumaji. I believe that will be easier to recognize, read and remember.

This mod adds a couple ships that were inspired from a moderately popular space game. (You may have heard of it.) Ship specs (ie, thrust, turning speed, cost, etc) are decided using existing ships of similar types.

I made this mod for fun and to learn the basics of modding for 3030 Deathwar. I'm not planning on adding any additional ships to this mod unless the community shows interest.

If you would like a specific ship added then send me on my Discord and I'll see what I can do.

It tweaks all ships to better fit their designs and/or descriptions. Now, only the most expensive freighters have turn speeds that rival those of the cheapest fighters -- and some ships shouldn't consider combat at all. Fighters no longer have freighter class cargo space. Most of the niche ships (shuttle, mustang 8t, etc) now have a specialty and a big debuff. All of the Allrounders now have special debuffs, and some are more expensive. The EVA Jetsuit is now kind of amazing. Try it. It's cheap, even in Hard Mode -- just buy an ECM as soon as possible.

----------------Here's my vision of how this mod is meant to be played:
-freighters can't maneuver, but get plenty of missile capacity and cargo space and decent warp speeds to make quick getaways
-even some of the cheapest fighters can fly circles around most combatants in a 1v1, but they now lack turrets by default and have limited missile capacity and very, very limited cargo space
-the ""fun rides"" are for you grunt workers out there who just want a space taxi sim.
-the jetbikes and EVA Jetsuit are now perfectly suited for combat if you play defensively

Best when used with: Hard Mode, War Bigger Bounties, the custom ship mods, Space Evolved. This means missiles will be, basically, one-shot kills that need to hit a target worth at least 30k for you to make money. The 300k+ bounty missions in WBB are especially useful for acquiring quick funds. The custom ship mods give you an out if you need a good ship in the midst of all these debuffs. And Space Evolved is just beautiful.

Not compatible with: Missile World

Update: There was a bug that happened any time a missile exploded within the loaded map area, and another whenever a shipyard screen with a custom mod ship was loaded. These have both been fixed. A new game is NOT NECESSARY, but you might get a glitch where the top part of the space HUD (cargo/temp/etc) looks weird. To fix this, ditch some cargo the normal way (it should work) or sell at a station. Voila.",No,Yes,No,826,12,202,N/A

The idea, basically, is: You no longer get to have a ship with SS+ stats across the board after 10 hours of gameplay. Here, it's a new ship, a new upgrade, or more skin-of-your-teeth defences like missiles (possible OHKO -- if they hit) and Spark Boosts. Oh, and those OHKO missiles work both ways.

This mod changes costs and stats for almost every missile, bomb, weapon and upgrade in the entire game. It's very likely you'll switch to obsolete upgrades to afford missiles or a Spark Boost for a War Bigger Bounties job saying it'll pay you 700k if you can cut through 42+ pirates and obliterate a most wanted bounty. It's even more likely you'll sit in your ship outside of a station immediately after accepting that job, studying your HUD and trying to get a lock on the 700k mark because missiles are scary now and you don't want to fly a Bac Mk 2 anymore.

An absence of wreckage and coffee still fuels the needs of those wanting to risk it all in spite of the unknown doom of those that went before.

With security in the Safe Zone diminishing, now is the time for Nebula Tech to capitalise with a selection of nebula gas enhanced upgrades and weapons ... for a price.

This mod is intended to add some extra goals post main quest, nothing is vastly over-powered and in most cases I increased the value by an extra third or double so you will see and feel the difference but you can still die.

The tractor beam has the same stats as the M3 Yokohama as I can't seem to increase it any more than that without breaking it.

Pirates will equip the weapons.
